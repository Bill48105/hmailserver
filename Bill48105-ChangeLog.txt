* Upgraded to SA protocol 1.2 to allow size to be passed to/from SA for better confirming SA results (Thanks rolaids0/JamesDR for the patch!)

2012-02-21
* NEW: hMailServer.INI [Settings] BackupMessagesDBOnly=0 ;Defaults to 0 or disabled. When set to 1 backups & restores with 'messages' selected will backup ONLY database info for messages & NOT the actual Data folder. This can be useful to migrate between databases or if you backup files yourself. WARNING! Even with this enabled hmail still deletes domain folders & users during restore!!! Plus with this enabled you MUST backup your Data folder with some other method!!  This will be worked on later but common sense says you should always backup before restoring anyway so you've been warned. ;)
* NEW: Logging to show if Messages are being backed up or restored based on the INI value.
* FIX: File permissions of 7z backup could be admin-only or incorrect when backing up messages due to 7za temp folder usage. Now using hmail's temp folder instead of system temp.

2012-02-16
* NEW: INI option to forcibly drop a connection that exceeds a certain transfer size. WARNING! THIS IS AGAINST RFC but come on seriously, without this someone could send to you FOREVER hogging your connections & wasting bandwidth. So if you enable this just set it high enough that it won't be hit under normal circumstances but to catch craziness like the 1GB one that tried coming in here last week. This can also help stop wasted bandwidth from users running email client sending emails over & over with stuck super large messages in Outbox or at least limit how much they can send.
* New INI setting: SMTPDMaxSizeDrop=100000 Defaults to 0 or disabled. Number of KB to allow before forcing a 552 drop for incoming email.
* FIX: rolaids0 updates to how hmail formats headers to fix SA "RDNS_NONE Delivered to internal network by a host with no rDNS" issues & perhaps others.  Before: HELO ([ip]) After: HELO (PTR [ip]) Example Received: from bay0-omc2-s11.bay0.hotmail.com ([65.54.190.86]) becomes Received: from bay0-omc2-s11.bay0.hotmail.com (bay0-omc2-s11.bay0.hotmail.com [65.54.190.86]) (I realize it looks redundant but normally they SHOULD match but having both values allows SA to do tests properly.

2011-12-01
* NEW: Icons added to show disabled domains, accounts, aliases & dist lists in left tree to easily distinguish between enabled/disabled. (Appears to work)

2011-11-19

* New INI settings: LoadHeaderReadSize=4000 LoadBodyReadSize=4000 (max of 50,000 due to static buffer size). Defaults shown if not defined.

* NEW: Added 3 new hmailserver.INI values to control the new indexing. [Settings] IndexerFullMinutes=720 IndexerFullLimit=25000 IndexerQuickLimit=1000 Defaults shown if not defined. (Appears to work but potential for issues. IMPORTANT: Limit values untested but should work)
2011-11-15
* TWEAK: rolaids0 updates to reduce load due to indexing queries. FULL (original) done at startup & every ~720min & new QUICK (last 1000 new messages) done every minute. (Appears to work but potential for issues. IMPORTANT: If more than 1000 messages are received in a minute some will not be indexed until next FULL)
2011-11-04
* NEW: Confirmation "Are you sure?" added before delete email from queue to avoid accidental removal & data loss (Appears to work)
* NEW: Confirmation "Are you sure?" added before starting restore to avoid data loss as tables dropped & Data tree deleted (Appears to work)
* NEW: Can now edit the mail.hmailserver.com hostname used for testing outgoing ports in diags (Appears to work)
* NEW: SMTP connection banner now shown in diagnostic results (Appears to work)
* TWEAK: Built-in backup now LOGS error notice for > 1.5G & FAIL aborts > 15G instead of failing @ 1.5G limit as prior (Untested)
* NEW: Added error logging for restore if copying of temp folder fails (Untested)
* TWEAK: Added -t7z -mmt -mx1 params to 7z compression during backups to reduce memory & CPU usage at lower compression (Appears to work)
2011-11-03
* NEW: Added oClient.HELO to OnAcceptMessage and OnSMTPData which contains SMTP HELO string (Appears to work)
* NEW: Added TEMP logging to test & debug oClient.HELO (Appears to work)

2011-10-30
* NEW:  Hold connection for 5 seconds for IP range deselection or > max connections due to multi-per-second pounding after autoban. Note: User setting to come if change kept (Appears to work - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES)
2011-10-28
* FIX: Issue where ETRN/HOLD messages were incorrectly queued for delivery and possibly still shown in queue after delivery (Appears to work)
* TWEAK: Additional logging for when error occurs from hmail trying to delete message that was already delivered that was false alarm due to ETRN/HOLD bug with no ill effect besides the erroneous logging.
2011-10-27
* TWEAK: Admin Status Start/Stop buttons now Pause/Resume to help minimize confusion (Appears to work - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES)
* TWEAK: Admin Status now has hint to use Windows to start/stop service (Appears to work - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES)
* TWEAK: Added script server exception to logging
2011-10-26
* FIX: Dupe messages being sent to some users if there was a fail on some users on same message due to message ID changing & hm_messagerecipients not being updated correctly.
* TWEAK/FIX: Messages with no servers found were bounced immediately even if the reason was temp DNS failure. Now always treated as temp & queued for max tries instead. (Appears to work - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES)
* FIX: IMAP FETCH filename 'corruption' due to incorrect decoding of wrapped filenames that were not encoded. (Appears to work but POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES)
* FIX: Apple Mail IMAP BODY PEEK attachment corruption. (Appears to work - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES)
* FIX: Quota + internal backup space being ignored for mssql ce users. (UNTESTED - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES IN RELATED AREAS)
* TWEAK: Message read buffer lowered from 10000 to 4000 to test performance difference. (UNTESTED - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES IN RELATED AREAS)
* TWEAK: Header read buffer lowered from 50000 to 4000 to test performance difference. (UNTESTED - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES IN RELATED AREAS)
2011-10-25 & earlier
* TWEAK/FIX: MessageUndeliverable string from database now used to prepend Subject on bounces. (Risk of user having changed previously & wasn't used now is which could cause confusion)
* FIX: Queue randomness Win2K crash work-around (rnd skipped if disabled/default)
* FIX: Wrong MSSQL upgrade scripts. (UNTESTED - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES IN RELATED AREAS)
* TWEAK: Tweak to prioritize small & newer emails in queue delivery order. Assumption is that large emails will take longer to deliver tying up queue vs just getting rid of smaller emails 1st and messages with high # of tries are not likely to go anyway so why tie up newer emails in queue. (TEST WORKING AS EXPECTED)
* NEW: Added %MACRO_ORIGINAL_HEADER% for ability to include original headers in undeliverable message (UNTESTED - POTENTIAL FOR ISSUES IN RELATED AREAS)
* NEW: Added some LIST logging (should be changed to DEBUG only but needed something quick)
* TWEAK: Adjusted 550 reject responses for LISTS to help sender understand why rejected (owner vs not list member). 
* NEW: Comments-only for now regarding how plain text passwords in hmail are not case sensitive & perhaps that should be changed but worries about backward compatibility. (Not sure how long that has been that way or how many people rely on fact they are not case sensitive)
* TWEAK: Fixes for SURBL lookup issues due to URL's not being recognized across line wraps (TESTED WORKING AS EXPECTED)
* NEW: Comments added as reminder to consolidate URL's before lookups to eliminate dupes and allow user to define max URL's & time.
